# Chip Simulator Android

This folder is reserved for the Android app. Add your native project (Kotlin/Java) or a cross-platform wrapper (React Native, Capacitor, Flutter) here.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Decide the Android stack and scaffold the project inside `apps/android`.
- Point it at the same backend/Firebase project used by the web and iOS apps.
- Document build and release steps in this file once the project exists.
