# App Store Content Rating Guide

## Your Calculated Rating: 18+

Your app received an **18+** rating because it contains:
- **Frequent Simulated Gambling** (poker and blackjack games)

This is expected and appropriate for a casino chip simulator app.

## Korean Game Rating (GRAC) Number

### Do You Need It?

**Only if you want to publish in South Korea.**

- If you're **not** planning to release in South Korea: **Leave this blank** or skip it
- If you **do** want to publish in South Korea: You'll need to get a rating from the Game Rating and Administration Committee (GRAC)

### How to Get GRAC Rating (If Needed)

1. Visit: https://www.grac.or.kr/ (Korean Game Rating Board)
2. Submit your app for rating
3. Pay the rating fee
4. Receive your rating classification number
5. Enter it in App Store Connect

**Note**: Most developers skip this unless they specifically target the Korean market. You can always add it later if you decide to publish there.

## Age Suitability URL (Optional)

This is **completely optional**. You can provide a URL that explains:
- What your app does
- Why it's rated 18+
- Any age-appropriate information

### Options:

1. **Leave it blank** (recommended for most apps)
   - Apple's rating system already explains the 18+ rating
   - No additional URL needed

2. **Link to your app's website/README**
   - If you have a website explaining the app
   - Example: Link to your GitHub README or app website

3. **Link to a privacy/terms page**
   - If you have terms of service that explain the app's nature

### Example URL (if you want to provide one):

If your app has a website or you want to link to your GitHub:
```
https://github.com/javiirf/chipsim
```

Or create a simple page explaining:
- The app is for entertainment only
- No real money gambling
- Educational/simulation purposes

## What the 18+ Rating Means

- Users must be 18+ to download your app
- App Store will show "17+" or "18+" depending on region
- Parents can restrict downloads using Screen Time
- This is standard for casino/simulated gambling apps

## Can You Lower the Rating?

**Not really** - Simulated gambling apps are typically rated 18+ by Apple's guidelines. To get a lower rating, you'd need to:
- Remove simulated gambling features (defeats the purpose of your app)
- Make it educational only (not a game simulator)

**Recommendation**: Keep the 18+ rating. It's appropriate for your app type.

## Next Steps

1. **Korean Rating**: Leave blank (unless you're targeting South Korea)
2. **Age Suitability URL**: Leave blank (optional, not required)
3. **Click Continue/Next** to proceed with your submission

The 18+ rating is correct and expected for a casino chip simulator app. This won't prevent your app from being approved - it's just informing users about the content.

## Important Notes

- The 18+ rating is **not a rejection** - it's just a content classification
- Many successful casino/simulator apps have 18+ ratings
- Users who are 18+ can still download and use your app
- This rating is consistent with your app's purpose

## Summary

✅ **Korean GRAC Number**: Leave blank (unless publishing in South Korea)  
✅ **Age Suitability URL**: Leave blank (optional)  
✅ **18+ Rating**: This is correct and appropriate  
✅ **Proceed**: Continue with your App Store submission
