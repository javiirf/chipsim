## Prompt:

Create an iOS app icon design for "ChipSim" - a digital chip tracker app for poker and blackjack games. 

**App Description:**
ChipSim is a casino chip simulator app that helps players track their chips during poker (Texas Hold'em) and blackjack games. It's a utility app for managing virtual chips, tracking statistics, and simulating casino betting scenarios.

**Design Requirements:**
- Size: 1024x1024 pixels (square, high resolution)
- Format: PNG with transparent background (or solid background that works well)
- Style: Modern, clean, professional casino/card game aesthetic
- Must be recognizable at small sizes (iOS icons are displayed at various sizes down to 20x20 pixels)

**Visual Elements to Include:**
- Casino poker chips (can be stacked or individual)
- Card suit symbols (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs) - subtle integration
- Casino/gambling theme but professional and not overly flashy
- Consider incorporating the letter "C" or "CS" for ChipSim in an elegant way

**Color Scheme Options:**
- Option 1: Classic casino green felt background with gold/white chips
- Option 2: Dark navy/black background with colorful chips (red, blue, white, green)
- Option 3: Elegant gradient background (dark to lighter) with metallic chip accents
- Option 4: Minimalist design with a single prominent chip and subtle card elements

**Style Preferences:**
- Modern iOS design language (similar to Apple's design guidelines)
- Slightly rounded corners (iOS automatically applies corner radius, but design should account for this)
- Clean, minimalist but recognizable
- Professional appearance suitable for App Store
- Should convey: casino games, chips, betting, poker, blackjack

**Technical Notes:**
- The icon will be displayed on iOS devices
- iOS automatically adds a slight shadow and rounded corners
- Avoid text that's too small (it won't be readable at small sizes)
- Ensure the design works in both light and dark mode contexts
- Consider how it looks on different colored backgrounds

**Avoid:**
- Real money gambling imagery (this is a simulator/tracker)
- Overly complex designs that won't scale down well
- Text that's too small or detailed
- Cluttered compositions

**Output:**
Please provide a 1024x1024 pixel app icon design. If using an AI image generator, specify that it should be suitable for an iOS app icon with clean edges and a design that works at multiple sizes.
